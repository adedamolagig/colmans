    Amirâ€™s research is broadly focused on firms' information environment in capital markets. His research generally examines the economic consequences of voluntary and mandatory corporate reporting and forensic accounting (reporting quality) issues. He is particularly interested in firms' information environment and disclosure choices during major corporate events such as mergers & acquisitions. His research in banking focuses on the effects of accounting - in particular fair value accounting - and of regulatory risk-based capital requirements on banks' economic choices (capital management and leverage, risk and liquidity management) and the wider economic consequences thereof. Further research interests include non-financial reporting, such as environmental, social and governance reporting, and the intersection of accounting with corporate finance and investment problems.</p></li>
